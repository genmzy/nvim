## Why changed?
- I am too busy to update configuration, but I want to use latest and plugins features of NeoVIM: faster, more feature-rich ...
- Most of keymaps are kept from [old](https://github.com/genmzy/nvim-old)
- Plugins outside LazyVim:
	- [DB](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui): Database connection and UI.
	- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [FZF-vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim): Telescope is bloody slow when use `grep_string` or `Buffer fuzzy find` for big directory and big file
	- [JK](https://github.com/rainbowhxch/accelerated-jk.nvim): accelerated-jk lua-edition
	- [Sudo](https://github.com/lambdalisue/suda.vim): sudo write and sudo read for privileges improve
	- [Translator](https://github.com/JuanZoran/Trans.nvim): Chinese translator plugin
	- [WildFire](https://github.com/gcmt/wildfire.vim): Smart visual selection
